# `@ocelot/server`

> Set of common server utilities used for Node.js-based apps at IBM.

## Install

Make sure to follow [Whitewater's instructions](https://github.ibm.com/Whitewater/npm-enterprise) for npm Enterprise and have an alias for the `@ocelot` scope that is mapped to the npm Enterprise registry.

For reference, this should look like `@ocelot:registry=https://npm-registry.whitewater.ibm.com/` and is located in your `~/.npmrc` file.

Afterwards, you can run the following command to add `@ocelot/server` to your
project:

```bash
npm init
npm install @ocelot/server --save --registry=https://npm-registry.whitewater.ibm.com/

# Or with yarn
yarn init
yarn add @ocelot/server --registry=https://npm-registry.whitewater.ibm.com/
```
